# Todo-App
A simple, elegant, and responsive To-Do List web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This app lets users add, mark as complete, and delete tasks — with data stored locally using the browser's LocalStorage, so your list persists even after refreshing the page.
🚀 Features
✅ Add new tasks

✏️ Strike through completed tasks

❌ Remove tasks from the list

💾 Persistent storage using localStorage

📱 Fully responsive design for mobile and desktop

💡 Subtle animations and clean UI
